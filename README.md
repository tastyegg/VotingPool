==========

Characters:
Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee,
Wolverine, Superman, Batman,
Pikachu, Solid Snake, PrincessPeach,
Goku and TeenageNinjaMutantTurtles.

==========
Changes:
Fixed constraints to compensate for large images.
Somewhat colored GUI.
Start-up index for which battle is random; the array is not shuffled.
Chuck Norris's pic is zoomed up.

What needs to be done:
Put more battles!
Change filenames for "princesspeach" to "prince peach", "tnmt" to "teenage ninja mutant turtles", and "solidsnake" to "solid snake" for correct name tags.

Refer to README for fighters to match up.

Note:
Previous commit logs corrupted. Xcode commiting messaging sucks.

Changes:
Embedded Parse Framework
Working Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris images.
"Next" Button added to the bottom of the screen.
- Cycles to the next battle.
Made buttons' Background Images to regular Images
Changed contentMode of images. This allows the image to stretch, center, or fill to aspect ratio.

Need to do, but can't do:
Without access to the database, I can't add "battles".
Seriously, there are only 2 battles in the database; that'll look really stupid.

Will do:
Add/edit images to fit vertically.
