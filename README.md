==========
Note:
Previous commit logs corrupted. Xcode commiting messaging sucks.

Changes:
Embedded Parse Framework
Working Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris images.
"Next" Button added to the bottom of the screen.
- Cycles to the next battle.
Made buttons' Background Images to regular Images
Changed contentMode of images. This allows the image to stretch, center, or fill to aspect ratio.

Need to do, but can't do:
Without access to the database, I can't add "battles".
Seriously, there are only 2 battles in the database; that'll look really stupid.

Will do:
Add/edit images to fit vertically.
